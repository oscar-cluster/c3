Version 2.7

	Changed tool names from cl_*(t) to c*(s). 

Version 2.7.1

	Added C3 man page (man c3). 
	Fixed file open error message bug in cpush(s) that misreported that 
		the node list could not be opened, when actually it was the 
		list of files to be pushed which could not be opened. 

Version 2.7.2

	C3 now available as an RPM 
	C3 is now installed in /opt to conform with the Linux Standards Base 
		(LSB) Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) 
	Updated cpushimage to use SystemImager v1.5.0 
	C3_RSH environment variable should now be set to the path to the 
		binary that C3 should use instead of the default ssh. 
		Previously, C3_RSH was set to 1 if the user wanted to use rsh
		instead of ssh. 

Version 3.0

	Total rewrite of codebase
		using python 2.x
		new config file format
		new command line format
		dropped cps
		dropped serial versions of everthing but cexec

Version 3.1
	
	changed "#!/usr/local/bin/python" to use "/usr/bin/env pyhton2" for 
		portability
	fixed bug where temporary filename stays around (see version 3.0's 
		known bug list)
	when using the cpush -l option if you had more than one space between
		the source and destination cpush failed, you can now have
		any amount and type of white space
	when using cpush with the -l option if there is a blank line execution fails,
		the blank line is now skipped
	now only reads the clusters specified on the command line from the 
		configuration file
	addedd --all option to all the tools
	when using the c3_com_obj.get_clusters() it changed global values instead of local
		values, usefull if using the libraries for your own scripts
	cname can now search multiple names in one command
	when using a direct remote cluster and not using ssh for comminication the scripts
		would still use ssh in one call
	added a "contrib" section of unsupported example scripts (see README
		in contrib directory)
	added c3 command line parser and file parser documentation in the contrib section.
	added the --pipe option, should make it easier to pipe cexec commands
	changed the directory structure of the man pages

Version 3.1.1
	
	--pipe did not handle single line output correctly, now fixed.
	cexec now sorts stderr along with stdout
	*^C no longer prints call stack to screen

Version 3.1.2
	
	fixed cexec where output from a cexec command that is over the system buffer length would hang
	when using cpush with the --head option other command line options were not 
		executed correctly
	fixed a problem where --blind didn't apply when using a file list
	Specifying a cluster on the command line that doesn't exist now gives an appropriate
		error message and tries the next cluster.
	changed the --blind option in cpush to use "rm -f" instead of "rm -rf". This could cause entiere
		directories to be erase (C3 doen not support directoies with cpush)
	when using cnum with an indirect remote cluster it actually executed cname
	added some documentation to the parsing internals for other people to use.
	when using -f or --file with cpush it looked for the alternate configuration file on remote cluster (it
		should have looked for /etc/c3.conf).
	added a --all option to cnum

Version 4.0
	each cluster runs in its own thread, this allows scalable runs of C3 (see README.scalable)
	use of supercluster groups for scalability
	ability to run commands as an alternate user per cluster
	ability to set a different default path to remotly find the c3 commands per user (allows the scalable
		cluster to run entierly in user space)
	ability to specify a different default configuration file per user. (NOT DONE!!!!!!)
	fixed a bug where :torc: would match both the defalut cluster and torc
		instead of being an error
	ability to run as a different user per cluster (see c3-range(5) man page)
	made a few error messages more descriptive
	fixed a bug where if an index on the command line was out of range
		execution quit, it now ignores.

Version 4.1
    Include a new installation mechanism based on a Makefile
    Reduced cpush default verbosity, see C3_VERBOSE EnvVar (from Erich Focht)

Version 5.0
    Internal only release, skipped to v5.0.1 for packaging/distribution reasons.

Version 5.0.1 
    cpush now requires a destination as well as a source (see man pages)
    cpush now supports the use of wildcards on command line (see man pages)
    Changed the way versioning is handled in the utilities and added
       '--version' option.
    Improved error code handling for the tools.
    Created two new APITests to test return codes for cexec.
    Created new APITests for cpush and updated the old ones to include the 
       new changes.
    Do not install c3 in /opt/c3-x anymore but directly on the system (e.g.,
       binaries in /usr/bin).
    Put error codes and default location into a seperate module (include) file
    Added support to crm for deleting multiple files at once.
    Improved internal build system, and added automation of release process.
    Fix for MANPATH (Bernard Li)

Version 5.1.0 
    Fix the man path for Debian packages.
    Include a new binary packages for contrib.
    Update the contrib/c3_conf_manager script so we can add and remove nodes from a given cluster
    Fix bug causing large output to hang cexec - thanks Erik Jacobson (see Ticket#17)
    Require Python >= 2.4, migrate to subprocess module (see Ticket#16)
    Fix ckillnode pid lookup with long process name (see Ticket#15)
    Update copyright stamps to span proper years (2000-2011)

Version 5.1.1 
    Fix a problem in contrib/c3_conf_manager where we were calling delete_cluster instead of del_cluster.

Version 5.1.2 
    Fix a permissions issue on the contrib files.

Version 5.1.3 (not yet released)
    Recreate the c3-profiled RPM when running 'make rpm'

    Install the c3cmd filter scripts in the appropriate directory
    Fix usage and del/addnode error with contrib/c3_conf_manager (ticket#34)
    Add version flag to contrib/c3_conf_manager
